# guile-rs

Safe Rust bindings to [GNU Guile][gnu_guile].

## Status

@shymega took over maintainership of this project around July 2017,
and work is in progress on updating this crate. Stay tuned, and feel
free to join the IRC channel!

## Community

The IRC channel is no more, as Mozilla switched to Matrix.

I am looking into a different way to communicate, possibly Zulip.
