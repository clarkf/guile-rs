guile-rs
========

Safe Rust bindings to [GNU Guile][gnu_guile].

## Current status

So, I took on maintainership of this project from its previous maintainer, David
Li.

Since then, things have stalled, but people still seem interested. I noted
several implementations of Rust Guile bindings, including a fairly complete one
on GitLab.

In the next few weeks, I intend to reach out to all these maintainers of the
bindings, and make a proposal to unify it all into this `guile-rs` GitHub
organisation (it'll be mirrored to GitLab, but primarily developed on GitHub),
so that we can progress faster and unify effort into one single project.

I did put it on hold for a while, but I now have a better understanding of Rust. 

I'm really keen to develop a community and developer foundation for Rust and
Guile support, and further to that end, a Code of Conduct and Matrix/IRC
channels will be arranged soon.
